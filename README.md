# My Articles About JavaScript

JavaScript is one of the most important technologies in Web Development. Therefore my goal is to keep improving my knowledge and understanding of it in order to become a better JavaScript Developer. Writing articles will definitely help me to better understand topics I'm learning, but also it will help me to improve my writing skills.

In addition to writing my articles on Gist, I will publish my articles on [Hashnode](https://amertricic.hashnode.dev/) platform.
